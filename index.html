       <section id="Reason">

<p> The reason why I made the website about supporting my friends is becasue I want them to have a better chance for new people to see their design and what they do. So I picked two friends that I know and had permission to do this. So this is my midterm website. But this webiste is just a start when I startlearning more about web design this page will look so much better than now.</p>
